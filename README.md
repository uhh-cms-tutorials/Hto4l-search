# Higgs --> 4 Leptons Search
Search for Higgs bosons in the four-lepton final state

Project for [Physik Projekttage](https://www.ppt.uni-hamburg.de/) for pupils. The goal of the project is to plot the four-lepton invariant mass in CMS events and search for Higgs boson signals. The data are from the 2012 public data set and are provided as lepton four-vectors in csv format.

Accompanying introductory slides are [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/mschrode/outreach/-/tree/master/Higgs_analysis_project?ref_type=heads) (no public access).
